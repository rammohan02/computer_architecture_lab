# computer_architecture_lab
Lab and project work of computer architecture

All the lab work is implemented in Verilog, and the course project is implemented using Python as a cover to use these verilog files.

Lab 1: Double Precision Floating Point Adder

Lab 2: Double Precision Floating Point Multiplier

Lab 3: Recursive doubling based carry-lookahead adder

Lab 4: 64 bit Wallace Tree Multiplier

Lab 5: Register file

Lab 6: Cache

Lab 7: 64-bit Logical unit

Project: Implementation of Tomasulo Algorithm
